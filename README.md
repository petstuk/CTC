# Chase the Chickens

Celebrate a friend's birthday with a thrilling game of "Chase the Chickens"! This fun and engaging game requires players to navigate through two areas densely populated with pubs, each approximately 1 kmÂ² in size, ideal for hosting two separate games.

## Getting Started

To help you set up the game, I have written a Python script that generates HTML code displaying maps of the two selected areas. The main game rules are included on the `index.html` page.

Additionally, an AI-generated image depicting two chickens lost in a pub enhances the visual appeal of the game setup. Some light Photoshop skills were applied to add a title on top of the image, giving it a professional touch.

### Game Rules

For those interested in playing, the rules of "Chase the Chickens" can be found in the HTML code. Please refer to this section to understand how to play the game and what to expect during gameplay.

### Customization

If you'd like to customize the maps or make other modifications, feel free to reach out. I can provide you with the Python code so you can tweak the settings and adapt the maps to your preferred locations.

### Contact

If you need the Python code or have any questions about setting up or playing the game, please send me a message, and I'll be happy to assist.

## Happy Chasing!

We hope you enjoy playing "Chase the Chickens" as much as we do. Have a fantastic game night!
