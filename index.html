        <h3>Rules</h3>
        <ol>
    <li> Everyone puts £20 in a pot (per game).</li>
    <li> People draw names out of a hat to form teams. The first name is a chicken and gets to select their fellow chicken. The fine for declining the honour of being chicken is 3 shots of gin.</li>
    <li>The 'captain' of the team (the first player drawn) must setup FindMyPhone with a chicken for tracking throughout the game (can be removed instantly after).</li>
    <li> The chicken gets the pot of money, buys the assembled teams a drink, and goes to secure itself in a pub or bar within the pre-determined boundaries of play.</li>
    <li> All the teams depart the starting pub 30 minutes after in search for the chicken simultaneously. Your drink must be finished.</li>
            <li> The chicken drinks through the pot of money. If asked why he or she is wearing a costume, the only acceptable answer is “what costume?”.</li>
            <li> The teams go in search of the chicken. If a team checks a pub that doesn’t house the chicken, they can’t move on until everyone in the team has had a drink. You have to enter the pub and post a picture of you with a pint in the group chat.</li>
            <li> When a team finds the chicken, they get to join in drinking through the pot of money.</li>
            <li>The losing teams buy a shot of gin.</li>
            <p>Notes: The chickens can track the players using FindMyPhone. If the chickens don't think you are entering the pubs quick enough, you can be awarded a gin.</p>
